	<h1>Sri Lanka</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Sri Lanka is a beautiful island nation located in the Indian Ocean, just off the southern coast of India. Known for its rich history that spans over 2,500 years, Sri Lanka is home to a diverse cultural heritage, influenced by Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity. The island's stunning landscapes include tropical forests, golden beaches, and rolling tea plantations, making it a popular tourist destination. Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, is a vibrant city that blends modernity with colonial architecture, while ancient cities like Anuradhapura and Sigiriya offer glimpses into its past. The country has faced challenges, including a long civil war that ended in 2009, but has since focused on reconciliation and economic development. Sri Lanka is also known for its warm hospitality, delicious cuisine, and vibrant festivals, making it a unique and captivating place to visit.
